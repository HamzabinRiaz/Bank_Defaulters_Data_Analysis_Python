```

## Libraries

**Pandas**: We used Pandas for data importation, cleaning, and preprocessing.

**NumPy**: We used NumPyâ€™s function argmax to find the index of the maximum absolute value in the coefficients array. 

**os**: We used os for accessing the working directory.

**Matplotlib**: We used Matplotlib for creating a variety of plots, such as, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts.

**sys**: We used sys for interacting with the Python runtime environment.

**re**: We used re to find rows with special characters and then remove.

**seaborn**: It is based on matplotlib but its a high level data visualization library. Plotted heat maps with the help of this library

## Description

We have taken the dataframe of bank defaulters, and using the data we have performed several tasks.

Data Summary / Description: We have performed various functions to understand dimensions, missing values, variables, types of variables, and much more about it.
Data Visualisation - We have tried to visually represent different variables of the dataframe. Some of them like: Surname, Customer ID, and row number were not considered.
Data Cleaning - We have added another column of "IsDefaulter" that was helpful in different visualisation techniques, and removed some rows where Surnames had inappropriate values.
Hypothesis Testing (2 hypotheses)
Predictive Analysis - After how much time customers are likely to exit the bank

## Dataset

The Dataset used is a Dataset of Bank Loan defaulters showing their names, countries, ages, Gender, Bank account balances, Estimated salaries, how long they have been with the Bank, whether they have credit cards or not, and so on.
